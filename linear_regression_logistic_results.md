Explanation:

OLS Regression Results
This section provides an overview of the regression model and its performance metrics.

Dep. Variable: body_mass_g

The dependent variable we are trying to predict is body_mass_g (body mass in grams).
R-squared: 0.850

The R-squared value indicates that approximately 85% of the variance in the body mass can be explained by the model.
Adj. R-squared: 0.847

The adjusted R-squared value accounts for the number of predictors in the model. It is slightly lower than the R-squared value, indicating a good fit.
F-statistic: 322.6

The F-statistic tests the overall significance of the model. A high value indicates that at least one of the predictors is significantly related to the dependent variable.
Prob (F-statistic): 1.31e-92

The p-value associated with the F-statistic is extremely low, indicating that the model is statistically significant.
Log-Likelihood: -1671.7

The log-likelihood value measures the goodness of fit of the model. Higher values (less negative) indicate a better fit.
No. Observations: 233

The number of observations (data points) used in the model.
AIC: 3353.

The Akaike Information Criterion, used for model comparison. Lower values indicate a better fit.
BIC: 3371.

The Bayesian Information Criterion, similar to AIC but with a higher penalty for models with more parameters.
Coefficients
This section provides the estimated coefficients for each predictor in the model, along with their standard errors, t-values, p-values, and confidence intervals.

| Coefficient | Value | Std. Err | t | P>|t| | [0.025 | 0.975] | |-------------|-------|----------|---|-----|-------|-------| | Intercept | 2032.2111 | 354.087 | 5.739 | 0.000 | 1334.510 | 2729.913 | | C(sex)[T.Male] | 528.9508 | 55.105 | 9.599 | 0.000 | 420.371 | 637.531 | | C(species)[T.Chinstrap] | -285.3865 | 106.339 | -2.684 | 0.008 | -494.920 | -75.853 | | C(species)[T.Gentoo] | 1081.6246 | 94.953 | 11.391 | 0.000 | 894.526 | 1268.723 | | bill_length_mm | 35.5505 | 9.493 | 3.745 | 0.000 | 16.845 | 54.256 |

Intercept: 2032.2111

The estimated body mass when all predictors are zero.
C(sex)[T.Male]: 528.9508

The effect of being male on body mass, compared to the reference category (female). This coefficient is positive and significant (p < 0.000), indicating that male penguins tend to have a higher body mass.
C(species)[T.Chinstrap]: -285.3865

The effect of being a Chinstrap penguin on body mass, compared to the reference category. This coefficient is negative and significant (p < 0.008), indicating that Chinstrap penguins tend to have a lower body mass.
C(species)[T.Gentoo]: 1081.6246

The effect of being a Gentoo penguin on body mass, compared to the reference category. This coefficient is positive and significant (p < 0.000), indicating that Gentoo penguins tend to have a higher body mass.
bill_length_mm: 35.5505

The effect of bill length on body mass. This coefficient is positive and significant (p < 0.000), indicating that an increase in bill length is associated with an increase in body mass.
Diagnostics
Omnibus: 0.339

A test for normality of the residuals. A low value indicates that the residuals are normally distributed.
Prob(Omnibus): 0.844

The p-value associated with the Omnibus test. A high value (above 0.05) suggests that there is no evidence against the normality of the residuals.
Durbin-Watson: 1.948

A test for autocorrelation of the residuals. Values close to 2 indicate no autocorrelation.
Jarque-Bera (JB): 0.436

Another test for normality of the residuals.
Prob(JB): 0.804

The p-value associated with the Jarque-Bera test. A high value suggests that the residuals are normally distributed.
Skew: 0.084

A measure of the asymmetry of the residuals. Values close to zero indicate symmetry.
Kurtosis: 2.871

A measure of the "tailedness" of the residuals. Values close to 3 indicate a normal distribution.
Cond. No.: 798.

A measure of multicollinearity. Values much higher than 30 may indicate multicollinearity problems.
Notes
Standard Errors: Assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified.
Warning
FutureWarning: The ci parameter in the sns.barplot function is deprecated. Use errorbar=None for the same effect.
Prediction
The predicted body mass is: 3627.68 g
This is the predicted body mass based on the input values provided by the operator.
